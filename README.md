# PCA-for-Dimensionality-Reduction

This TP introduces <b>principal component analysis (PCA)</b>, a well-known and widely used <b> dimensionality reduction </b> method.
The idea in PCA is to find the directions of maximal variance in data, and consider only those while discarding all the rest of the variations.

The concepts covered in this notebook are: principal component analysis (PCA), explained variance, correlation circle...

We will also see some applications of the PCA on real data such as the lfw_people database.
